# Project-My-Ally

**DESCRIPTION:**

_My Ally_ is the AI-powered virtual friend which helps you know your future and takes away the intimidation and awkwardness of interacting with real people. It will practice and face scenarios you are likely to encounter in the best way possible. This platform also performs a wide range of assistive features.

**PROBLEM DEFINITION:**

Across cultures and history, we discover individuals wanting to grasp their future. People are continually attempting to seek out their own life to know how badly things can go and to decide how much work they need to put into it to change unusual things into satisfying outcomes in the future.

**PROJECT PERSPECTIVES:**

In an attempt to broaden the ancient secrets of prediction, _My Ally_ is designed in the pattern of Rogerian Therapy and practices Chaos Theory for divining the future. As each human has the power to find the best solutions to their own problems, this therapy believes that users cometo their conclusions about issues and solve their problems with the support of this application. This system is well understood and calculable since the variable here is the “user” itself. Eventually, the user controls the majority of the communication and it helps to magnify the future. _My Ally_ as a virtual friend, it currently aims to assist and performs the tasks of the user. Apart from providing a wide range of assistive features, it will also help you in divining the future.
